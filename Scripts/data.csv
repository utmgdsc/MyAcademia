This course introduces students to some classic attempts at addressing this question with specific reference to the nature of personhood and social life. By engaging with the writings of Marx, Weber, Freud, and DeBeauvoir among other great thinkers of the modern age, students will develop deeper knowledge of the major theories guiding anthropological research. We will pay close attention to how arguments are constructed in these texts and focus on the methodologies that these pioneers of social thought developed in their inquiries.

  ANT212H5 , Who am I? Topics in Identity and Difference,"Who am I? This course gives a sociocultural anthropological answer to this question by focusing on culture as a fundamental means by which humans make society. In particular, it considers how the symbolic systems through which humans conceptualise the world and communicate with one another play a fundamental role in defining identity (who you are) and difference (who you aren't). Through cross-cultural comparison, the course shows how the identities and differences we often consider 'natural' - sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity and others - are in fact the product of culture and society. Thus, who you are is a question that must be answered in relation to categories others will recognise and allow you to be. ",0.5,Social Science,None,None,None
  ANT214H5 , Anthropology of Food and Nutrition,"This course explores human food use and nutrition from a broad anthropological perspective.

  ANT215H5 , How Should One Live? An Introduction to the Anthropology of Ethics,"Few questions are more obviously important than that which Socrates poses in Plato's Republic: ""how should one live?"" This course considers the various ways this question has been asked and the answers it has received across a range of very different contexts. It begins with Socrates' address to the Athenian assembly in The Apology and his conclusion that the examined life is the only one worth living. We then turn to the Greek past and the Homeric background against which the reflective life, that Socrates exemplified, stood in stark contrast. With this background in place we will proceed to consider the various ways in which the question of how one should live has been answered across of a range of social settings. Drawing on ethnography as well journalism and documentary film we will consider, for instance, Rastafarianism, Jainism, living ""off-grid"" in North America, deaf communities in the US, transgenderism, and non-binary gender identity.

  ANT218H5 , The Social Conquest of Earth,"This course is a quest for the secret of human uniqueness. The success of Homo sapiens, has been described as ""a spectacular evolutionary anomaly"" that has resulted in human domination of the Earth's biosphere. We will use the comparative method to journey through the Animal Kingdom in hopes of discovering the preadaptive elements that enabled such incredible evolutionary success. On our way we will survey chimpanzee warfare, tool using octopuses, eusocial ants, and night-time hunter-gatherer sentinels - all of which will allow us to better understand the forces that shaped unparalleled cooperative networks in humans. Finally, we will investigate the cognitive and behavioural blessings and curses associated with the drive to belong to a group. The goal of the course is to equip students with a greater understanding of the human condition - and how to leverage this understanding to improve their lives. ",0.5,Science,None,None,None
  ANT219H5 , How Do We Know? The Social Anthropology of Knowledge,"“How do we know what we know?” is a question that has long concerned anthropologists. And in a world like ours – where “fake news,” religious credos and conspiracy theories coexist with common sense, mainstream media and scientific truth(s) – the question seems more important than ever. This course explore anthropological insights into knowledge and the question of how we know. To do so we will examine a range of contemporary knowledge-making activities which may include surveillance, witchcraft, conspiracy, governance, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data.

  ANT221H5 , The Trust Paradox,"The ultimate question that all life is bound to ask is: how do I survive? Our species, evolved a uniquely human answer, which led to our ascendance as the most dominant on the planet but at what cost? This course explores a central human paradox: how altruism, community, kindness, and war and genocide are all driven by the same core adaptation. We'll call this the Trust Paradox and the evolution of this suite of traits, best described as coalitionary cognition, is one of the most complex and ancient in our species. We will explore how this, often imperceptible drive, is responsible for our capacity for both cooperation and competition, and allowed us to navigate increasingly complex social landscapes.

South Asia is a place where many external cultural traditions mixed with indigenous traditions to create new socioeconomic and sociopolitical entities and sequences. While we will examine classic examples of hunter-gatherer groups, early villages, urban settlements, regional polities, and large empires through time, we will also stress the contemporaneity of groups of people with very different lifestyles -- hunter-gatherers participated in trading networks with town and city dwellers, pastoral nomads moved through settled village regions during their annual migrations. The impact of archaeological research on the region today is seen through the politicization of South Asian prehistory and history that has strongly affected both interpretations of the past and modern political events. Cases such as the debate over the identity of the Harappans and the existence of the Aryans will be evaluated from both an archaeological and a political perspective.
